Project created with `npx create-cljs-app treefinder`.

To run with Emacs/Cider, install deps with `yarn` or `npm install`, open a src file and `cider-jack-in-clj&cljs`; choose `shadow` as the REPL type and `:app` as the shadow-cljs build when prompted. You should be asked if you want to open the site at port 3000. After doing so, changes to src files should cause the site to automatically reload. Evaluating forms within a Emacs buffer should work correctly. Note that when the page opens initially if a stale output warning persists you may have to wait a bit and reload the page.

Following is the generated README.md:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create CLJS App](https://github.com/filipesilva/create-cljs-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.

The app uses [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io), a minimalistic interface between ClojureScript and React.<br>
You can use existing npm React components directly via a [interop call](http://reagent-project.github.io/docs/master/InteropWithReact.html#creating-reagent-components-from-react-components).

Builds use [Shadow CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) for maximum compatibility with NPM libraries. You'll need a [Java SDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) (Version 8+, Hotspot) to use it. <br>
You can [import npm libraries](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#js-deps) using Shadow CLJS. See the [user manual](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html) for more information.

### `yarn cards`

Runs the interactive live development enviroment.<br>
You can use it to design, test, and think about parts of your app in isolation.

This environment uses [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `public` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles all code and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Other useful scripts

### `null` and `yarn e2e`

You can use `null` to run tests a single time, and `yarn e2e` to run the end-to-end test app.
`yarn test` launches tests in interactive watch mode.<br>

See the ClojureScript [testing page](https://clojurescript.org/tools/testing) for more information. E2E tests use [Taiko](https://github.com/getgauge/taiko) to interact with a headless browser.

### `yarn lint` and `yarn format`

`yarn lint` checks the code for known bad code patterns using [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo).

`yarn format` will format your code in a consistent manner using [zprint-clj](https://github.com/clj-commons/zprint-clj).

### `yarn report`

Make a report of what files contribute to your app size.<br>
Consider [code-splitting](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2019/03/03/code-splitting-clojurescript.html) or using smaller libraries to make your app load faster.

### `yarn server`

Starts a Shadow CLJS background server.<br>
This will speed up starting time for other commands that use Shadow CLJS.
